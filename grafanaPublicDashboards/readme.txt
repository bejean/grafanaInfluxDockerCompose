This folder overrides the corresponding folder that comes with a vanilla grafana installation.
As shown in the docker-compose.yml file, here is the specific folder used by my docker container:
/usr/share/grafana/public/dashboards

The files in this folder game from here:
https://grafana.com/grafana/download/4.2.0
I downloaded the MS-Windows .zip distribution and unzipped the files from there.
